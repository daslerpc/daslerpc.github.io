<p><strong>Computer science researcher</strong>, with an interest in computational geometry, the Internet of Things, game theory, and artificial intelligence. 

My work has focused on computational problems that involve working in and moving around shared physical spaces. Viewed through the lens of algorithmic theory, I have explored how self-driving cars can safely travel through an unregulated intersection without stopping, how such intersections could affect city-wide traffic, how best to organize an automated warehouse without knowing <i>a priori</i> the popularity of items in stock, and how best to create a low-cost Internet of Things ecosystem for a seamless, indoor navigational experience with minimal cognitive load.
