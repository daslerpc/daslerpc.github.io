The \[MIT Mystery Hunt(https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/) \] is a weekend-long puzzle hunt held every January on MIT's campus.  Tradition dictates that it is the winning team's duty to write and host the hunt for the following year.  I was fortunate enough to be on the winning team in 2019 and the hosting team in 2020. This year we had 150 registered teams, ~3400 players, and a hunt that lasted over 50 continuous hours of puzzle solving goodness.
