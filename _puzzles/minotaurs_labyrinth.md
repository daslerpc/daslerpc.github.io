Navigate the labyrinth and help Theseus defeat the minotaur.  This puzzle was written for The Gauntlet, an annual gaming charity event held at Mox Boarding House in Seattle.

A longer description of this project is forthcoming. If you can't wait, contact me and I'd be happy to discuss it with you in greater detail.
