A mailbox which only opens when the correct sequence of letters is touched on its side.  Installed as a puzzle challenge in an escape room, it exists in a fully connected IoT environment.

A longer description of this project with pictures is forthcoming. If you can't wait, contact me and I'd be happy to discuss it with you in greater detail.
